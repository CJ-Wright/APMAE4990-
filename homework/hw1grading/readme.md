# Homework 1 Grading

## Problem 1:

- Did the student properly clone the assignment repo, add the notebook, and push it to the repo? (10 points)
- If the student had some difficulty in this instance and was unable to push for whatever reason, deduct 3 points. In the future assignments will not be accepted that aren't properly pushed to the assignment repo however.


## Problem 2 (Sales data):
- Part 0: Did they make a boxplot? (3 pts)
- Part 1: Did they make scatter plots of each feature with sales and explain the plots? (5 pts). (subtract a point if they don't explain the plots)
- Part 2: a) - f) (3 points each) subtract a point for anything that's wrong (ie. if they evaluate on training data)
- Part 2: g) Do they realize they need to normalize features? (5 points if yes, 2 points if no).
- Part 2: h) 3 points if the expanation is correct.

## How could you have improved performance? (marked as a bonus)
- Did they plot the regression in 3d and introduce an interaction term, or any kind of non-linear model which improved performance? (10 points)
- Partial credit for plotting the scatter plot and hyperplane in 3d (3 points) with no explanation. 

## Gradient Descent
- Did they discuss the three cases we discussed in class (slowly convergent, divergent and 'good') to any extent? (ie. did they do anything visual or otherwise to convince you they understood the concepts? (10 points)
